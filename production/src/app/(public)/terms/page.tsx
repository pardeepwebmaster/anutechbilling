/**
 * Terms of Service — ResellerOS, governed by Indian law (Maharashtra jurisdiction).
 *
 * Reasonable boilerplate for a B2B SaaS:
 *   • Account terms + acceptable use
 *   • Subscription + payment (Razorpay)
 *   • IP ownership (we own the platform, customer owns their data)
 *   • Warranty disclaimers + liability cap
 *   • Indemnification
 *   • Termination + data export window
 *   • Indian governing law + Mumbai jurisdiction
 *
 * Not legal advice. Operator should have counsel review before live use.
