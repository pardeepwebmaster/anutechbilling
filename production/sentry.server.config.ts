/**
 * Sentry — Node.js server init (route handlers, server components, server actions).
 *
 * Only initialises when SENTRY_DSN is set. Filters out tenant_id and PII
 * from event payloads before sending — see beforeSend below.
 *
 * NOTE: On Cloud Run + Next.js 14.2 standalone, instrumentation.ts is NOT
 * called at boot, so this file is currently a fallback. Server-side init
 * actually happens via the module-level guard in /api/sentry-test/route.ts.
 * Keep this file for future Next.js versions where the hook works.
