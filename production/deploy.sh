# Canonical ResellerOS production deploy — the ONE way to ship.
#
# Why this exists: on 25 Jul 2026 several deploys were wasted because the
# project id and gcloud account were guessed from stale docs. This script
# hard-codes the correct values and PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS them (account, project
# access, right directory) BEFORE the 3–5 min Cloud Build — so a wrong config
# fails in ~2 seconds with a clear message instead of a slow, confusing error.
#
# Usage:  bash deploy.sh          (run from anywhere; it cd's itself)
# Auth:   Pardeep runs `gcloud auth login` (interactive) himself first.
# ============================================================================
