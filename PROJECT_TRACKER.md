- Pricing + landing page

### Month 2: Customer hunt
- ICP list of 50 Indian cloud resellers

- 3 paying customers (₹999/mo Starter tier)
- Personal demos + customer success stories

### Month 3: Iterate on feedback

- Top 10 bug fixes
- AA integration (Setu) — paying customer demand
- Case studies
- **Goal: 10 paying customers, ₹15K MRR**

## 🔑 World-class success metrics

| Metric | Today | 90-day target | World-class target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Paying customers | 0 | 10 | 100 |
| MRR | ₹0 | ₹15K | ₹2L |
| Lighthouse score | unknown | >90 | >95 |
| Time to first value | unknown | <5 min | <2 min |
| Uptime SLA | unknown | 99.5% | 99.9% |
| NPS | n/a | >40 | >60 |
| Monthly churn | n/a | <5% | <2% |

---

## 🚫 What NOT to do (avoid these temptations)

- ❌ Adding new features without paying-customer demand
- ❌ Database migration (Firebase, Cloud SQL) — Supabase is the right call
- ❌ Tech stack changes (Next.js + Supabase = solid)
- ❌ More TSP integration (Setu signup is enough work)
- ❌ Hindi i18n until 100+ customers
- ❌ Native mobile app (PWA covers it)
- ❌ Chasing self-serve AA TSP URLs (sales-led signup is the only path)

## ⚠️ Known issues + pitfalls

| Issue | Workaround |
|---|---|
| Google OAuth not yet enabled in Supabase | Use email/password login until OAuth Client configured |
| Setu AA real-time fetch | Use CSV upload monthly (or mock mode for demos) |
| Cross-tenant ID collision on quotes/POs | Currently mitigated with renamed prefixes (e.g. PO-ET-...) — composite PK migration pending |
| Screenshot tool timeout on first-compile pages | Wait 5-8 sec after navigate, retry once |
| Browser Chrome MCP can't navigate to Cloud Run URL | Localhost works fine; Chrome extension domain permission limitation |

## 🤖 Claude conventions (for future sessions)

- **Always read this file at session start** to know current priorities
- **Never add new features without paying-customer demand** (architect rule)
- **Always run `npm run typecheck && npm run lint` before commit**
- **Always use `gcloud run deploy resellersos --source . --region asia-south1`** for deploys
- **Always commit with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`**
- **Skip `.github/` from staging** until GitHub PAT has `workflow` scope
- **Use Hinglish in operator-facing messages** (Pardeep's preference)
- **Push back as Product Architect** when scope/timing is wrong
