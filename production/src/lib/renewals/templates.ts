/**
 * Renewal email templates — tone escalation from soft → final + grace.
 *
 * Each template is pure data (no I/O). Caller renders by interpolating
 * the placeholder fields. Subject + body kept in the same object so a
 * future "preview email" UI can show both side-by-side.
 *
 * Tones (matches CADENCE_TRIGGERS):
 *   • soft       — T-15 + T-12. Heads-up tone, customer-friendly.
 *   • friendly   — T-9. "Just a reminder."
 *   • firm       — T-6. "Please confirm to keep service active."
 *   • urgent     — T-3. "Interruption ahead."
 *   • final      — T-0. "Today is the day. Service suspends without payment."
 *   • grace      — T+1..T+grace. "You're in the grace window. Pay now."
