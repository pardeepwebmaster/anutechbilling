## 0. Why a V3 — what changed since V2

V2 PRD (2026-05-19) described a single-product Google Workspace reseller CRM on Firebase. The actual built product diverged significantly:

| Dimension | V2 PRD | V3 Reality |
|---|---|---|
| Product name | LeadOS V2 | **ResellerOS** |
| Scope | GW only | **GW + M365 + Zoho** + multi-product |
| Tenancy | Single agency | **Multi-tenant** with RLS |
| Stack | Firestore + Firebase | **Supabase Postgres + Cloud Run** |
| Search | Algolia indexed | Server-side Postgres queries |
| Functions | Firebase Cloud Functions | API routes + cron handlers |
| Modules built | 6 (V2 scope) | **17 shipped modules** |
| Customer-facing | None | **Customer portal + public buy pages** |
| Compliance | GST mentioned | **GST + HSN + DPDP + TDS + multi-step** |
| Channels | Web only | **Web + PWA + WhatsApp + email** |
| Partner channel | Not in scope | **Distributor → reseller hierarchy built** |
| Banking | Not in scope | **Multi-bank CSV import + AA scaffold** |

V3 is not an aspirational doc — it documents what's already in production at Excel Technologies (the dogfooding tenant) and Anutech Digital (the partner tenant).

## 1. Product Vision

**ResellerOS is a multi-tenant operating system for Indian cloud resellers** — solo SaaS hustlers to 100-employee distributors — that replaces the 5-7 disconnected tools they juggle today (CRM spreadsheet, Tally, Zoho Books, WhatsApp, Gmail, bank-statement paperwork, Razorpay dashboard, GST return prep) with one cohesive operating layer.

```
Lead inbound → Qualify → Quote (GST-compliant) → Send (email/WhatsApp/PDF)
        ↓
Accept (with/without payment) → Customer auto-created → Subscription seeded
        ↓
Invoice generated (CGST §31) → Razorpay collect → Receipt voucher (CGST §31(3)(d))
        ↓
Renewal cadence T-30 / T-15 / T-7 / T-0 → Auto-suspend with grace
        ↓
Bank reconciliation (CSV or live AA) → Accounting layer → GST return prep
        ↓
TDS receivable cycle → Form 26AS reconcile at year-end
```

**Success metric:** A reseller can run their entire month-end ops cycle inside ResellerOS without opening Tally, Zoho Books, their bank's portal, Razorpay dashboard, WhatsApp business, or a single spreadsheet.

**North-star metric:** Number of paying tenants × average MRR (currently 0 paying, target 10 in 90 days, 100 in 12 months).

## 2. User Personas

| Persona | Permissions | Daily surface |
|---|---|---|
| **Owner** (Pardeep at Excel Tech) | Full access — billing, settings, all data, partner channel | Dashboard → Leads/Deals → Quotes → Invoices → Renewals → Banking → Reports |
| **Sales rep** (Darshan at Excel Tech) | Owned leads + own deals + own quotes; read-only customers; cannot delete; no Import CSV; no campaigns | /leads → /deals → /tasks → /support |
| **Support/Ops** | Customers + subscriptions + invoices (no quote pricing edit) | /customers → /subscriptions → /support |
| **Accountant / Finance** | Invoices + payments + TDS + banking + GST reports | /invoices → /payments → /banking → /reports |
| **Customer portal user** (the reseller's own customers) | Magic-link login; their own subscriptions/invoices/tickets only | /portal/* (separate origin / brandable) |

RBAC implementation: `users.role` column + RLS policies that respect role. The `users` table has `role` enum and `permissions` JSONB for per-feature flags (e.g., `can_view_deals` for restricted sales role).

---

## 3. Tech Stack (current, accurate)

| Layer | Tech | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | **Next.js 14.2.15** (App Router) | RSC-ready, mature, Cloud Run friendly |
| Language | TypeScript strict | No `any`, no `@ts-ignore` |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui base | Token system, dark-mode-ready |
| Database | **Supabase Postgres** | RLS, realtime, free-tier generous |
| Auth | **Supabase Auth** (email/password + Google OAuth) | SSR-aware, custom-claims-ready |
| State (server) | TanStack Query v5 | Optimistic mutations, focused refetches |
| State (forms) | React Hook Form + Zod | Type-safe schemas |
| Animations | Framer Motion (sparingly) | Drawer + dialog transitions |
| Charts | Recharts | Bundle-friendly |
| Command palette | cmdk | Cmd+K universal search |
| Toast | sonner | Top-right, dismissable |
| i18n | next-intl (English only; Hindi prepped for 100+ customers) | Pluggable later |
| Icons | lucide-react (wrapped in `<Icon>`) | Single import surface |
| Email | **Resend** | Domain-verified sending |
| Payments | **Razorpay** (test mode → production after KYC) | India-first, UPI/Cards |
| GST verification | **Sandbox.co.in** (with mock fallback) | Two-step token flow |
| WhatsApp | **Gupshup BSP** | India BSP, send + webhook + media |
| Bank statements | CSV parser (HDFC/ICICI/SBI/Axis/Kotak/IndusInd/Yes Bank) | Period-suffix safe |
| Account Aggregator | **Setu API** (mock-first, switches to live with env keys) | RBI-regulated bank data |
| PDF | `@react-pdf/renderer` (server-side) | Quote + Invoice + Receipt PDFs |
| Monitoring | **Sentry** (error tracking) + **BetterStack** (uptime) | Wired with chokepoint pattern |
| Hosting | **Google Cloud Run** (asia-south1, Mumbai) | Container-based, autoscale to 0 |
| Source control | GitHub | Branch deploys, gh CLI |
| Tests | Vitest + Playwright | Unit + E2E (cross-tenant fixture) |
| CI | GitHub Actions workflow | typecheck + lint + smoke on every push |

### What's intentionally NOT in stack

- ❌ Algolia / Elasticsearch — Postgres full-text + Supabase queries cover Cmd+K
- ❌ Redis — TanStack Query cache + Supabase pooling is enough
- ❌ Microservices — monolith is correct at this scale
- ❌ Kubernetes — Cloud Run handles orchestration
- ❌ GraphQL — REST + Supabase client gives the same DX for less complexity

---

## 4. Multi-tenancy + RLS (the architectural foundation)

Every table except `tenants` and `users` has `tenant_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(id)` and **Row-Level Security enabled**. The canonical RLS policy:

```sql
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON <table>
  FOR ALL
  USING (tenant_id = (SELECT tenant_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()));
```

This means a logged-in user CAN ONLY see/modify rows in their own tenant. Cross-tenant leakage is impossible at the database layer, regardless of bugs in app code.

**Multi-tenant SaaS pattern**: Each `tenant` is one reseller business. Excel Technologies and Anutech Digital are two real tenants today; both have their own catalog, leads, quotes, customers, etc.

**Partner channel exception**: When a distributor (parent tenant) issues an invoice to its child reseller (downstream tenant), a `vendor_bill` row is auto-created in the child's tenant via a `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC that bypasses RLS in a controlled way. This is the only sanctioned cross-tenant write.

### Verification rules

- **Every PR adding a new query MUST have a Playwright cross-tenant test** verifying it can't read another tenant's data. Existing fixture at `e2e/fixtures` sets up two tenants and asserts isolation.
- **Service-role key is server-only.** Never exposed to client.
- **Code review checklist** flags any query missing `.eq("tenant_id", ...)` or RLS bypass.

## 5. Data Model (current Supabase schema)

The full schema lives in `production/supabase/migrations/` (0001 → 0040+ at time of writing). High-level tables:

### Core entities

| Table | Purpose | Key columns |
|---|---|---|
| `tenants` | One row per reseller business | `id`, `name`, `gstin`, `state_code`, `subscription_tier`, `reseller_tier` (`distributor` / `reseller`) |
| `users` | Team members across tenants | `id` (= auth.uid), `tenant_id`, `email`, `role`, `permissions` JSONB |
| `leads` | Both raw inquiries AND qualified deals (split by `plan` field) | `company`, `contact_name`, `plan`, `stage`, `value`, `owner_id`, `follow_up_date`, `priority` |
| `customers` | Closed-won leads upgraded | `legal_name`, `gstin`, `state_code`, `billing_address`, `primary_contact` |
| `contacts` | Standalone contacts (pre-lead) | `name`, `email`, `phone`, `tenant_id` |
| `items` | Product catalog (GW Starter, M365 Premium, etc.) | `name`, `hsn` (default 998313), `prices` JSONB (monthly + annual tiers) |
| `quotes` | Sent quotations | `quote_number` (Q-YYYY-YY-NNNN), `customer_id` or lead-context, `line_items` JSONB, `status`, `payment_status`, `total`, `tax_breakdown` JSONB |
| `subscriptions` | Active customer subscriptions | `customer_id`, `item_id`, `seats`, `commitment`, `start_date`, `renewal_date`, `status` |
| `invoices` | GST tax invoices | `invoice_number` (INV-YYYY-YY-NNNN), `irn` (e-Invoice IRP, when wired), `qr_code`, `line_items`, `tax_breakdown` |
| `payments` | Razorpay + manual payments | `quote_id` or `invoice_id`, `amount`, `method`, `razorpay_payment_id` |

### Money + accounting

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `vendor_bills` | Bills FROM vendors (Google / Microsoft / etc., or parent distributor) |
| `expenses` | Operational expenses |
| `purchase_orders` | POs raised to vendors |
| `bank_accounts` | Multi-bank list per tenant |
| `bank_transactions` | CSV-imported bank statement rows |
| `bank_aa_connections` | Setu AA consent + sync state |
| `tds_receivables` | TDS deducted by customers, recoverable via Form 26AS |

### Engagement

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tasks` | Follow-ups, generic to-dos |
| `activities` | Timeline events (calls, emails, meetings, notes) |
| `campaigns` | Bulk email campaigns (newsletters, offers) |
| `whatsapp_messages` | Gupshup BSP inbox |
| `support_tickets` | Customer portal tickets |

### System

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `document_sequences` | Per-tenant + per-fiscal-year invoice/quote/PO numbering |
| `audit_logs` | (Planned) actor/action/entity/before/after for sensitive ops |
| `partner_catalog_sync` | Distributor → reseller item mirror state |
| `tenant_settings` | Per-tenant config (renewal grace days, Razorpay keys, GSP keys, WhatsApp creds, etc.) |

### Money representation

- **Internally**: integer ₹ (no paise, except inside Razorpay calls)
- **`items.prices` JSONB**: `{ monthly?: {msrp, wholesale}, annual?: {msrp, wholesale} }` — both in **₹/seat/month** integers
- **`quotes.line_items[].rate`**: **₹/seat/YEAR** (canonical unit for math)
- **Display conversion** based on commitment:

```
commitment              invoicesPerYear   display unit
monthly                 12                /mo (flex)
annual_monthly          12                /mo (1-yr commit, monthly bill)
annual_quarterly         4                /qtr
annual_half_yearly       2                /half-yr
annual_yearly            1                /yr (default for prospect quotes)
```

---

## 6. Atomic Postgres functions (multi-row writes)

Any operation touching >1 row goes through a `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC. Never chain client-side Supabase calls — mid-flight failures leave the tenant inconsistent.

| RPC | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `next_document_number(p_doc_type)` | Atomic, gap-free, per-tenant per-FY sequence | ✅ live |
| `record_payment(...)` | Lead → customer cascade + receipt voucher + subscription update | ✅ live |
| `generate_invoice(...)` | From paid quote → invoice with `IRN` placeholder | ✅ live |
| `compute_advance_adjustment(...)` | Advance receipts applied to invoices | ✅ live |
| `accept_quote(...)` | Convert lead/customer + seed subscription on accept-with-payment | ✅ live |
| `refund_payment(...)` | (Planned) refund + outstanding recompute | ⏳ pending |
| `renew_subscription(...)` | Roll subscription forward + create next-period quote | ✅ live (Piece B of renewal lifecycle) |
| `seed_demo_data(p_tenant_id)` | (Planned) creates sample customers/leads/quotes for new tenants | ⏳ pending |

Document numbering format: `{PREFIX}-{YYYY}-{YY}-{NNNN}` (e.g., `INV-2025-26-0001`). Prefixes: `INV` (tax invoice), `RV` (receipt voucher), `RFV` (refund voucher), `CN` (credit note), `DN` (debit note), `Q` (quote), `PO` (purchase order).

## 11. Quality + Compliance (current state)

### Code quality

- TypeScript strict (`no any`, `no @ts-ignore`)
- ESLint + Prettier
- Pre-commit: `npm run typecheck && lint`
- Vitest unit tests (utilities)
- Playwright E2E (smoke, cross-tenant, lead-flow, role-permissions)
- GitHub Actions CI: typecheck + lint + smoke on every push

### Performance budgets (CLAUDE.md §12)

| Metric | Budget | Current |
|---|---|---|
| LCP | < 2.5s | Not measured (need Lighthouse CI) |
| FCP | < 1.5s | Not measured |
| CLS | < 0.1 | Not measured |
| Lighthouse Performance | > 90 | Not measured |
| Lighthouse Accessibility | > 95 | Not measured |
| Main bundle gzipped | < 200 KB | Not measured |

## 17. How this PRD is maintained

This PRD reflects the codebase at commit **`7e0bd49`** (2026-05-29). It is updated when:

1. A new major module is shipped (Phase rollup added)
2. A core architectural decision changes (tech stack pivot, multi-tenancy approach)
3. The roadmap pivots significantly
4. A previously-open decision is closed

For day-to-day task tracking, see **`PROJECT_TRACKER.md`** at repo root. For coding conventions and gotchas, see **`production/CLAUDE.md`**. For the brutal gap-vs-world-class assessment, see **`docs/WORLD_CLASS_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`**.
