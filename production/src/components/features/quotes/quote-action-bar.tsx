/**
 * QuoteActionBar — the money-lifecycle actions for a quote, usable anywhere a
 * quote is surfaced (quote hub, lead drawer, pipeline). It mirrors the quote
 * page's status-aware action bar so a rep never has to leave the drawer to move
 * a quote forward — "khali record payment se kaam nahi chalega".
 *
 *   sent / viewed (unpaid)   → Record payment · Mark accepted · Mark rejected
 *   accepted + awaiting pay  → Record payment
 *   partial / received / …   → a single button that opens the full quote hub
 *                              (where payment history / invoice / resend live)
 *
 * MONEY-SAFETY:
 *  - The inline "Record payment" path derives `alreadyReceived` from
 *    quote.payment_amount, and the total from the same frozen formula the quote
 *    hub uses (quotes/[id]/page.tsx). Anything with a partial/received history
 *    routes to the hub, which loads the authoritative payment_history.
 *  - "Mark accepted" / "Mark rejected" never touch money math — accept only
 *    converts the lead → customer (via the mark-accepted API) so the record
 *    exists before money lands; the subscription is still created later by
 *    record_payment when the payment is recorded.
