/**
 * Server-side Sentry initialiser — workaround for Next.js 14.2 standalone
 * mode on Cloud Run, where `instrumentation.ts` `register()` does not fire
 * at boot (verified 2026-05-29). Without init, captureException creates
 * event IDs locally but the transport never runs, so events silently drop.
 *
 * Import this module from any server-side file that wants Sentry to be
 * guaranteed-initialised (route handlers, server actions, cron handlers).
 * The init is module-level and idempotent — re-imports are free.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import "@/lib/sentry";  // side-effect import, init runs once
 *   import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";
 *   Sentry.captureException(err);
 *
 * When Next.js fixes the standalone instrumentation issue, this file can
 * be deleted and replaced with the canonical instrumentation.ts approach.
